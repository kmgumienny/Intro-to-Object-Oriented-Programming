## Description
This project extends on the first homework from my class. It incorporates an interface called IEvent and an abstract class called Athlete. This introduced the topic of agreements you make with the compiler. A function that incorporates an interface provides the specified functionality in the interface and how functionality for a family of objects can be instantiated as an abstract class that can't be initialized but can be inherited by subclasses.
