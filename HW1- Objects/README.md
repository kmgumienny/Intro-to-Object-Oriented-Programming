## Description
This project is the first homework assignment in Object Oriented Design concepts class. In this assignment, I transitioned to Java and made simple Objects and accessed their variables in multiple methods. JUnit tests are included in the code.

The project description is:
Inspired by the recent Olympics, a local organization plans to create a multi-sport athletic competition. For now, the competition will require every athlete to compete in two events: a cycling race and a short biathlon (of multiple rounds, each with trail running and target shooting). Your job is to create the initial software to record athletesâ€™ results in these events, and to provide methods that do some basic performance comparisons between individual athletes.
