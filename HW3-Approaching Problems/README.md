## Description
This program consists of 3 subproblems. Each of these subproblems are solved 2 different way in order to expand my critical thinking skills regarding the substructure in approaching a problem.

The three programs are as follows:

A program called bmiReport that consumes a list of personal health records (BMI scale classifies a value below 18.5 as “underweight”, a value at least 18.5 but under 25 as “healthy”, a value at least 25 but under 30 as “overweight”, and a value at least 30 as “obese”.) and produces a report containing a list of names (not the entire records) of patients in each BMI classification category. The names within each list in the report should be in the same order as in the original list of health records

A program called DataSmooth that smooths a data set by replacing each (internal) element of a sequence of values with the average of that element and its predecessor and successor. Assuming that extreme outlier values are an abberation caused, perhaps, through poor measurement, this averaging process replaces them with a more plausible value in the context of that sequence.

A program called dailyMaxForMonth that consumes a list of sensor data (doubles) and a month (represented by a number between 1 and 12) and produces a list of reports (maxHzReport) indicating the highest frequency reading for each day in that month.
