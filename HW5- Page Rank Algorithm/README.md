## Description
This project creates a page ranking algorithm. Two criteria will affect a page’s position in a results order:

-Whether many other pages link to this page (a measure of how valuable others think this page is) – this is the essence of the PageRank algorithm that Google uses.

-Whether the page is sponsored by an organization that pays money for its pages to be ranked higher.

This assignment has data structures that track sponsors, compute the rank of pages according to these two criteria, and  sort the results of runQuery accordingly.
